## The Goal

Jameson helps me manage my git branches and commits to write my blog created with hugo.
It's a collection of shortcuts bundled in a simple command, that will auto-run from your project directory.
It's nothing much, just a simple bash script. Still, it gets out of the way and allows you to focus on writting posts instead of reading the git manpages every few minutes.

### Features
- configure project directory so all commands run from there
- save files, create commits and push branches in a single command
- create new posts and uses hugo archetypes
- convert images to webp and import them into your project for better size optimization
- configurable through a config file
